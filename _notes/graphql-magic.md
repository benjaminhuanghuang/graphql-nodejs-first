## Type
    This is where we define what we want to respond to the user that is making the request, we can add some validations there and also we can define what type of data we are going to return.
- There are different type of types, we should import those from graphql and set what kind of data is the one that we are returning.
- Each type must be a GraphQLObjectType which will have multiple properties

## Query
    The queries are where we want to set the /GET that we want to let GraphQL do to our database, we set in the query the type of response that we want to give, so we can be sure which data we want to share.
